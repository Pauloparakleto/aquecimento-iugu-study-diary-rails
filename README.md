# Study Diary
## A study diary made on Rails 6
This is the Rails versions of [Study Diary Bash Version](https://github.com/Pauloparakleto/aquecimento-iugu-study-diary).

[Live demo](https://damp-reef-29097.herokuapp.com/)

Here the user need to login to see, search and create a task.

Main gems used:

> Devise for authentication;

> Simple_form to create forms for devise automatically;

> Ransack for search;

> haml-rails; (I'm tired to open tag and close tag like "katate kid staff")


Bootstrap was used.

## To do:
1 - The search bar task (done);

2 - The pagination;

3 - Category to act as taggeable;

## Disclaimer

1 - The currente version does not delete a task on the view (javascript staff).
